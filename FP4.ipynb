    "For our final project, we plan to analyze patterns in presidential speech in order to understand how the role of the president in establishing the national social agenda has changed over time. In particular, we’d like to focus on tracking the prevalence of different themes over time using feature analysis. Using our final output dataset, we will be able to visualize the progression and popularity of different social issues in presidential rhetoric at different points in time. For example, we plan to look into such patterns as gender-specific pronouns, and analyze speech readability using the Flesh-Kincaid test. Our finite dataset has 997 rows, restricted by the number of presidential speeches; this data was acquired primarily using an online corpora, and we used web-scraping to acquire the speeches of the 45th president. We have multiple features in the dataset -- for readability, we consider such attributes as word count, sentence count, and average syllables per word, and for sentimentality, we consider the frequencies of gendered pronouns, and terms pertaining to race/religion. The target/outcome variables for our dataset include political party, president, and time period, the last of which is to be indexed using 20-year blocks. We plan to use this data primarily to visualize trends of progressivism in presidential speeches over time; however, we also plan to work towards training a model to predict these target variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions regarding our dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Are there significant presidential speech sentimentality trends over time?\n",
    "* Which visualization types fit best for representing the attributes and trends of our dataset?\n",
    "* What machine learning algorithm (out of the ones we’ve seen used in class) can best classify the presidential speeches?\n",
    "* To what degree of accuracy can we get a machine learning algorithm to predict the aforementioned target variables? (Using cross-validation procedures)\n",
    "* Which feature variable will play the largest role in classification?\n",
    "* Can we train a machine learning classification algorithm to classify the political party from which the speeches came? \n",
    "* (This will utilize only speech data from after 1936, when the Democratic and Republican parties established their modern platforms.)\n",
    "* We also plan to test multiple hypotheses, including:\n",
    "* The frequency of female-gendered terms will increase over time.\n",
    "* The frequency of male-gendered terms will decrease over time. \n",
    "* The use of religious language will decrease over time. \n",
    "* The use of equality-related rhetoric will decrease over time. \n",
    "* Religious language will be a key indicator of political party.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project primarily tackles a classification problem, as we plan to train our model to predict political party (binary classification), speaker (multiclass classification), and year (multiclass classification using feature discretization, nbins= 20). We also plan to experiment with regressive prediction, utilizing speech year as a continuous outcome variable. Algorithm-wise, we plan to experiment with each of the models covered in lecture, as the sklearn library makes it easy to compare the performance of multiple algorithms on a dataset (kNN, SVM, Naïve-Bayes, Decision Trees; Linear, Polynomial, Ridge, and Lasso regression). We are particularly interested in evaluating the importance of each feature, using univariate and model-based feature selection. As mentioned, we plan to try using feature discretization for the regressive prediction component; we also plan to experiment using both bag-of-words and n-grams for feature extraction. By experimenting with preliminary correlation visualizations, we will be able to gauge whether our features are likely to demonstrate predictive capabilities; either way, we may chose to expand our feature analysis into other linguistic components -- for example, it may be an interesting challenge to determine if there are certain words which maximize prediction accuracy of the model, or consider such features as speech location at different geographical scales.\n"
